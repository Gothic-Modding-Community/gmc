# Standalone Scripts
Over the years Gothic modders have created many useful features to use with Zengin scripts. This section contains documentation for some scripts that are "standalone", meaning they are not part of larger packages, but are often small features to make modders lives easier.

## Script bins
A few people came up with the idea of collecting scripts scattered on the forums, which resulted in the so-called Script Bins.

!!! Warning
    Script bins aren't updated frequently, so for the latest updates and also new scripts check [ScriptBin WoG thread]().

### WoG Script Bin
