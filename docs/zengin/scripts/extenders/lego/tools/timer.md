# Timer
Timer is a better alternative to the timers that Gothic offers. The [FrameFunctions](frame_functions.md) and [Anim8](../applications/anim8.md) packages are already based on it. It isn't possible to modify the current time, as this would only cause difficulties.

## Dependencies
N/A

## Initialization
Initialize with `LeGo_Timer` flag.
```dae
LeGo_Init(LeGo_Timer);
```
## Implementation
[:material-github: Timer.d on GitHub](https://github.com/Lehona/LeGo/blob/dev/Timer.d)

## Functions

### `Timer`
Returns the current playing time. If a new game is started, the time is 0. It is measured in milliseconds.
```dae
func int Timer()
```
**Return value**

The function returns current playing time in milliseconds.

### `TimerGT`
Returns the current game time, but the timer is paused when the game is paused (in the menu or status screen).
```dae
func int TimerGT()
```
**Return value**

The function returns current playing time in milliseconds, but without measuring time when game is paused.

### `TimerF`
Alias to `Timer` function that returns the time as an Ikarus float value.
```dae
func int TimerF()
```
**Return value**

The function returns current playing time as an Ikarus float value.

### `Timer_SetPause`
Pauses the timer (and thus all [FrameFunctions](frame_functions.md) and running animations).
```dae
func void Timer_SetPause(var int on)
```
**Parameters**

- `#!dae var int on`  
    Pause on/off

### `Timer_SetPauseInMenu`
The timer can automatically pause when the game is paused. (status screen, main menu...)
```dae
func void Timer_SetPauseInMenu(var int on)
```
**Parameters**

- `#!dae var int on`  
    Automatic pause on/off

### `Timer_IsPaused`
This can be used to query whether the timer is paused.
```dae
func int Timer_IsPaused()
```
**Return value**

The function returns `TRUE` if the timer is paused, `FALSE` is returned otherwise.
