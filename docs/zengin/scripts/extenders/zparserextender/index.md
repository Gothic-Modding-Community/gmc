# zParserExtender
zParserExtender extends ZenGin's parser and adds many useful features. It significantly extends the functionality of scripts with added functionality and new external functions. It also enhances script compilation, allowing to compile OU files directly with the game and allowing for runtime script injection. Since the Union version `1.0m` zParserExtender is fully integrated in Union itself.
