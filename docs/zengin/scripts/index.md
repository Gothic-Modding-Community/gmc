# Scripts

ZenGin uses its own scripting language called Daedalus. It is similar to C programming language, so if you know some C programming, it will be quite easy to get started.

The `Scripts` directory is where the scripts live. You will be able to find Daedalus script files - `.d` extension and `.src` files, that list all files to be compiled.

## Tools
Daedalus scripts can be edited in any text editor. To get useful features like syntax highlighting you can use community developed tools:

### Gothic Sourcer
Gothic Sourcer is a tool that allows you to edit Daedalus scripts with syntax highlighting and built-in compiler. It also has a feature to decompile scripts from the game. However, it lacks support for script packages like [Ikarus](extenders/ikarus/index.md) and [LeGo](extenders/lego/index.md).

### Daedalus VS Code extension
The VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features for Daedalus scripts, and uses Daedalus Language Server as the back-end for them.
