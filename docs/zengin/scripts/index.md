# Scripts

ZenGin uses its own scripting language called Daedalus. It is similar to C programming language, so if you know some C programming, it will be quite easy to get started.

The `Scripts` directory is where the scripts live. You will be able to find Daedalus script files - `.d` extension and `.src` files, that list all files to be compiled.

Daedalus scripts can be edited in any text editor. To get useful features like syntax highlighting you can use community developed tools like 

- [Gothic Sourcer](../tools/gothic_sourcer.md)
- [Daedalus VS Code extension](../tools/daedalus_tools/daedalus_language_server.md)
