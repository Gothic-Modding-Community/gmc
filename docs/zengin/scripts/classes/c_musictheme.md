## Class member overview
Description of the class member variables.

### file
DirectMusic sound in *.sgt format or MIDI file. 

### vol
The volume of the theme song. From 0.0 to 1.0. 

### loop
Enable/disable theme music looping. Disabled = 0. Enabled = 1. 

### reverbMix
Reverb mixing. Measured in decibels. 

### reverbTime
Reverberation time in milliseconds.

### transType
The type of transition to the next theme song. 

The list of constants for all transitions types is described in the file [`Scripts/System/_intern/Music.d`](https://github.com/VaanaCZ/gothic-2-addon-scripts/blob/Unified-EN/_work/Data/Scripts/System/_intern/Music.d#L24)

```dae
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_NONE          = 1;    // No transition
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_GROOVE        = 2;    // Ripple
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_FILL          = 3;    // Padding
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_BREAK         = 4;    // Break
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_INTRO         = 5;    // Introductory
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_END           = 6;    // End topic
const int TRANSITION_TYPE_ENDANDINTRO   = 7;    // End and start new
```

### transSubType
The subtype of transition to the next theme song. 

The list of constants for all transitions subtypes is described in the file [`Scripts/System/_intern/Music.d`](https://github.com/VaanaCZ/gothic-2-addon-scripts/blob/Unified-EN/_work/Data/Scripts/System/_intern/Music.d#L33)

```dae
const INT TRANSITION_SUB_TYPE_IMMEDIATE = 1;    // Instant transition
const INT TRANSITION_SUB_TYPE_BEAT      = 2;    // Rhythmic transition
const INT TRANSITION_SUB_TYPE_MEASURE   = 3;    // Gradual transition
```

## Name features
The musical themes of the game are played depending on the game situation. By default, the theme with the `_STD` (standard) suffix is played. In case of a threat, the `_THR` (threat) theme will be played. During the combat the `_FGT` (fight) theme plays.

!!! Danger
    Make sure that you use proper naming convention for MusicThemes and [`oCZoneMusic`](../../worlds/Classes/zCVob/zCZone/oCZoneMusic/index.md) vobs. The theme with `OC_` prefix will play in a zone with name like `OLDCAMP_OC` or any other ending with `_OC`

```dae
instance WOO_DAY_STD(C_MUSICTHEME_STANDARD)
{
    file = "woo_daystd.sgt";
};
 
instance WOO_DAY_THR(C_MUSICTHEME_THREAT)
{
    file = "woo_daythr.sgt";
};
 
instance WOO_DAY_FGT(C_MUSICTHEME_FIGHT)
{
    file = "woo_dayfgt.sgt";
};
```
In addition, the suffix `_DAY_` and `_NGT_` determines whether the theme should be played on day or night.
```dae
instance OWD_DAY_FGT(C_MUSICTHEME_FIGHT)
{
    file = "owp_dayfgt.sgt";
};
 
instance OWD_NGT_STD(C_MUSICTHEME_STANDARD)
{
    file = "owd_daystd.sgt";
};
```
!!! Tip
    In G2 the `C_MUSICTHEME_STANDARD`, `C_MUSICTHEME_THREAT` and `C_MUSICTHEME_FIGHT` prototypes are used by default.
