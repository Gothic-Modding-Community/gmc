# Externals
External functions are Daedalus functions (defined in the engine itself) used to interface with the engine.  
Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 implements slightly different set of external functions.  
There are some external functions, that we used in the course of Gothics development, but are now obsolete/deprecated, since the underlying systems coded in the engine were either turned of, or broken all together.
