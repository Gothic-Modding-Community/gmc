# Externals
External functions are Daedalus functions (defined in the engine itself), that are used to interface with the engine. Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 implements slightly different set of external functions.  
There are some external functions, that were used in the course of Gothics development, but are now obsolete/deprecated because the underlying systems implemented in the engine were either turned off, or broken all together.
