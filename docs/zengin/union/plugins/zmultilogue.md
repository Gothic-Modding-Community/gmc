# zMultilogue

zMultilogue is a Multi-NPC dialogue system for Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 NotR, based on the solution form [AFSP Trialogue package](https://github.com/Bad-Scientists/AF-Script-Packet/blob/main/Standalone-Packages/G12-Trialogue/trialogue.d).
Its goal is to replace Trialoue packages based on [Ikarus](../../scripts/extenders/ikarus/index.md) and [LeGo](../../scripts/extenders/lego/index.md) with an union-based plugin.

!!! Info
    The plugin has its own [wiki](https://github.com/Silver-Ore-Team/zMultilogue/wiki), if you are interested in including zMultilogue into your project see the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/Silver-Ore-Team/zMultilogue/wiki/Getting-Started).
