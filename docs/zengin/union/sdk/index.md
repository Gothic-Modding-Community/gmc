# Union SDK
Union SDK is a software development kit for making Union plugins that directly interact with Gothic engines. It contains a project template for Visual Studio IDE, a C++ library for hooking into a Gothic executable, and Gothic API with methods' addresses for the engines of Gothic I, Gothic II, Gothic II NotR, and also for the not released Gothic Sequel. 

Working with Union SDK requires at least basic knowledge of C++ programming. Knowledge of the x86 (32-bit) architecture, dynamically linked libraries, and reverse engineering is also welcomed as we need to understand what the Gothic engine does under the hood to use it effectively. 

## Requirements
Union SDK requires Visual Studio IDE, NET Framework 4.7.2, and Visual C++ 2010 libraries. They are available on Microsoft websites:

* Visual Studio - [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
* NET Framework 4.7.2 - [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* Visual C++ 2010 - [https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=26999](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=26999)

## Resource Manager
The official installation of Union SDK is provided through [Resource Manager](https://worldofplayers.ru/threads/41415/). After the installation, Visual Studio will have a new project template "Union Plugin 1.0" that creates a basic Union plugin project.
