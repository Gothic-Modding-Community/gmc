# How to contribute
The Gothic Modding Community is a community-driven project. We encourage people to contribute.

This site is built with a Static Site Generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme together with multiple other MkDocs plugins.

Prerequisites for contribution differ based on the scale and type of the contribution.

## Feedback
You can either [open an issue](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/issues) via GitHub or [join us][gmc-discord] on Discord.

## Direct contribution
Direct contribution is made via creating a copy of this repository (a fork) and [creating](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/pulls) a pull request (PR) on GitHub with changes for approval.

!!! failure "Don't waste time"  
    Please make sure that the content you are contributing does not already exist on the [dev page](https://gmc.cokoliv.eu/). You can use the search tool to filter GMC for different keywords and contents.

!!! question "How to edit the source files?"  
    The source files for the articles are written using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) `.md` file format ([Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)). Other than that, this site also uses [Python Markdown Extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/) which add more syntax rules like indented [admonitions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/).

### Minor changes
Minor changes like fixing typos, grammatical errors or removing/adding words to paragraphs in a _single_ file can be done quickly with the pen button in the upper right corner of each article. This will open up a GitHub editing interface which will create a fork with a patch branch after modifying the file and guide the user to open up the pull request.

!!! warning "Select the correct branch for the pull request"  
    Make sure that the pull request is directed towards the [`dev`](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/tree/dev) or a special `pre-merge` branch and not the `main` branch.

### Major changes
More elaborate changes like editing multiple files at once, adding new articles, images, other miscellaneous files or changing the configuration of the page are easier to make via external tools on your local PC. While most of these operations can be done with the GitHub interface, it is rather cumbersome, and it may be harder to spot issues during the process as changes are not immediately visible in the browser.

Some preparation is needed before working on the files as MkDocs requires an installation of Python on the system to run. GitHub works on top of [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) so an installation of _git_ is also required. A basic familiarity with Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell command line interfaces is helpful.

#### System setup (video)
Firstly, you should install Python. You can follow this step-by-step tutorial for [Windows](https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg?t=351) or [macOS](https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg?t=85) on how to install Python.

!!! question "This video is from 2017?!"
    The process of installing Python hasn't changed since that point. However, please install the [latest][python-download] version of Python 3.

To work remotely with GitHub, you can install the [latest][git-download] version of _git_ on your system following [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

If you are planning to do some elaborate Python programming, you can follow this step-by-step tutorial for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20) or [macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4) on how to set up an environment with Visual Studio Code.

If you just plan on editing the content of the articles with Markdown, you can simply install the [latest](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) version of Visual Studio Code for GUI _git_ management and Markdown preview or work with any other familiar text editor and omit the environment setup.

#### System setup (text)
To prepare your system to run the project follow those instructions:

1. Install the [latest][python-download] Python version.  
    Make sure to select the **"Add Python to PATH"** option during the installation process.

2. Open up a Terminal/Command Prompt (cmd)/Powershell window.

3. Check that Python was properly installed with this command (might need a terminal restart):

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

4. Install the [latest][git-download] version of _git_ following [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

5. Check that _git_ was properly installed with this command (might need a terminal restart):

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

6. (optional) Install the [latest](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) version of Visual Studio Code for GUI _git_ management and Markdown preview.

#### Working locally
In order to work locally:

1. [Create a fork](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/fork) on GitHub.
2. Navigate to a directory where you want to clone your forked repository and open a Terminal window inside.
3. Clone the forked repository, using this command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/user-name/forked-repository-name.git DIR-PATH
    ```
    
    Replace the `DIR-PATH` with a directory name or `.` if you're inside the directory you want the project files to be in.
    
    Instead of `https://github.com/user-name/forked-repository-name.git` you ought to click on the green `<> Code` button and select the `HTTPS` tab.

4. Add the remote upstream repository using this command:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc.git
    ```

5. (optional) Create a Virtual Environment and activate it.

    If you work on multiple Python projects, it might be worthwhile to create a Virtual Environment for each project to have separate library directories with installed modules/plugins.
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
    This will create a `venv` directory inside the current Terminal directory. Please keep that name as it's added to the `.gitignore` project file.
    
    Depending on the system, use one of these commands to activate the virtual environment.
    
    ```bash title="Linux"
    # Linux / macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    ```powershell title="Windows"
    # Windows Command Prompt (cmd)
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # Windows Powershell
    venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
    ```
    
    After activation there will be a `(venv)` indicator near the Terminal prompt.
    
    !!! warning "Don't close the Terminal"  
        The virtual environment must be activated each time a new Terminal window is opened.

6. Install MkDocs with plugins using this command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This will install all dependencies.

7. Fetch the git history from upstream using this command:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

8. Checkout the upstream `dev` branch using this command:

    ```bash
    git checkout --track upstream/dev
    ```

9. Checkout the new branch based on the upstream `dev` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b name-of-branch
    ```
    
    An appropriate name for a branch is either a feature name or short description of what it changes - for example `3ds-articles`, `fix-typos-for-contribution`. They do not have to be elaborate, up-to 4 words suffices.

10. Start a server with MkDocs using this command:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    
    Visit the local site with this url [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/gmc/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/gmc/).  
    Any time you make change to any file, the website will rebuild itself and your browser will auto-refresh.
    
    The server may be closed using the `Control-C` shortcut while in the terminal/console.

11. When you are satisfied with a part of work, add and commit the files using these commands:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "add 3 articles about ZenGin"
    ```
    
    An appropriate commit message should be a sentence describing the changes.

12. When you are finished with the work, push the branch to origin using this command:

    ```bash
    git push origin name-of-branch
    ```

13. Create the pull request to the appropriate branch.

    After pushing your local branch to the remote origin, there will be a link available in the Terminal window. Use it to create the pull request using the pushed branch.

14. Another contribution:

    Before contributing again, always use these commands:
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream 
    ```
    to make sure that all the files are up-to-date. Follow then from step 9.


### Submit a file
If working with _git_ or Markdown is not viable or possible for you, you can submit files in a Google Docs format on the [GMC Discord server][gmc-discord] and we will format and upload it to the page.
