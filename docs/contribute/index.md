# How to contribute
The Gothic Modding Community is a community-driven project. We encourage people to contribute.

This site is built with a Static Site Generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme together with multiple other MkDocs plugins.

Prerequisites for contribution differ based on the scale and type of the contribution.

## Feedback
Using English, you can either [open an issue](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/issues) via GitHub or [join us][gmc-discord] on Discord.

## Direct contribution
Direct contribution is made via creating a copy of this repository (a fork) and [creating](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/pulls) a pull request (PR) on GitHub with changes for approval.

!!! failure "Don't waste time"  
    Please make sure that the content you are contributing does not already exist on the [dev page](https://gmc.cokoliv.eu/). You can use the search tool to filter GMC for different keywords and contents.

!!! question "How to edit the source files?"  
    The source files for the articles are written using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) `.md` file format ([Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)). Other than that, this site also uses [Python Markdown Extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/) which add more syntax rules like indented [admonitions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/).

### Minor changes
Minor changes like fixing typos, grammatical errors or removing/adding words to paragraphs in a _single_ file can be done quickly with the pen button in the upper right corner of each article. This will open up a GitHub editing interface which will create a fork with a patch branch after modifying the file and guide the user to open up the pull request.

!!! warning "Select the correct branch for the pull request"  
    Make sure that the pull request is directed towards the [`dev`](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/tree/dev) or a special `pre-merge` branch and not the `main` branch.

### Major changes
More elaborate changes like editing multiple files at once, adding new articles, images, other miscellaneous files or changing the configuration of the page are easier to make via external tools on your local PC. While most of these operations can be done with the GitHub interface, it is rather cumbersome, and it may be harder to spot issues during the process as changes are not immediately visible in the browser in their final form.

Some preparation is needed before working on the files as MkDocs requires an installation of Python on the system to run. GitHub works on top of [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) so an installation of _git_ is also required. A basic familiarity with Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell command line interfaces is helpful.

### System setup (video)
Firstly, you should install Python. You can follow this step-by-step tutorial for [Windows](https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg?t=351) or [macOS](https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg?t=85) on how to install Python.

!!! question "This video is from 2017?!"
    The process of installing Python hasn't changed since that point. However, please install the [latest version][python-download] of Python 3.

To work remotely with GitHub, you can install the [latest version][git-download] of _git_ on your system following [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

If you just plan on editing the content of the articles with Markdown, you can simply install the [latest version](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) of Visual Studio Code for GUI _git_ management and Markdown preview or work with any other familiar text editor and omit the environment setup.

If you are planning to do some elaborate Python programming, you can follow this step-by-step tutorial for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20) or [macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4) on how to set up an environment with Visual Studio Code.

### System setup (text)
To prepare your system to run the project follow those instructions:

1. Install the [latest version][python-download] of Python .  
    Make sure to select the **"Add Python to PATH"** option during the installation process.

2. Open up a Terminal/Command Prompt (cmd)/Powershell window.

3. Check that Python was properly installed with this command (might need a terminal restart):

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

4. Install the [latest version][git-download] of _git_ following [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

5. Check that _git_ was properly installed with this command (might need a terminal restart):

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

6. (optional) Install the [latest version](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) of Visual Studio Code for GUI _git_ management and Markdown preview.

### Working locally
In order to work locally:

1. [Create a fork](https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc/fork) on GitHub.
2. On your local PC navigate to a directory where you want to clone your forked repository and open a Terminal window inside.
3. Clone the forked repository, using this command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/user-name/forked-repository-name.git <DIR-PATH>
    ```
    
    Instead of `https://github.com/user-name/forked-repository-name.git` use your own link which can be found after clicking on the green `<> Code` button and selecting the `HTTPS` tab.

    Replace the `<DIR-PATH>` with a path to a directory or `.` if you're inside the directory you want the project files to be cloned into.

    This will automatically create a remote `origin` repository pointing to your own fork.

4. Add the remote `upstream` repository using this command:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Gothic-Modding-Community/gmc.git
    ```

5. (optional) Create a Virtual Environment and activate it.

    If you work on multiple Python projects, it might be worthwhile to create a Virtual Environment for each project to have separate library directories with installed modules/plugins.
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
    This will create a `venv` directory inside the current Terminal directory. Please keep that name as it's added to the `.gitignore` project file.
    
    Depending on the system, use one of these commands to activate the virtual environment.
    
    ```bash title="Linux / macOS"
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    ```powershell title="Windows Powershell"
    venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
    ```
    ```batch title="Windows Command Prompt (cmd)"
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
    
    After activation there will be a `(venv)` indicator near the Terminal prompt.
    
    !!! warning "Don't close the Terminal"  
        The virtual environment must be activated each time a new Terminal window is opened.

6. Install MkDocs with plugins using this command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This will install all dependencies.

7. Fetch the git history from `upstream` using this command:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

8. Checkout a new local branch based on the `upstream` `dev` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b name-of-branch --track upstream/dev
    ```
    
    An appropriate name for a branch is either a feature name or short description of what it changes - for example `3ds-articles`, `fix-typos-for-contribution`. They do not have to be elaborate, up-to 4 words suffices.

9. Start a server with MkDocs using this command:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    
    Visit the local site with this url [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/gmc/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/gmc/).  
    Any time you make change to any file, the website will rebuild itself and your browser will auto-refresh.
    
    The server may be closed using the `Control-C` shortcut while in the terminal/console.

10. When you are satisfied with a part of work, add and commit the files using these commands:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "add 3 articles about ZenGin"
    ```
    
    An appropriate commit message should be a sentence describing the changes.

11. When you are finished with the work, push the branch to `origin` using this command:

    ```bash
    git push origin name-of-branch
    ```

12. Create the pull request to the appropriate branch.

    After pushing your local branch to the remote `origin`, there will be a link available in the Terminal window. Use it to create the pull request using the pushed branch.

13. Another contribution:

    Before contributing again, always use this command:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream 
    ```
    to make sure that you have an up-to-date `upstream` git history. Follow then from step 8.

    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    
    This command allows to check, if there are any changes in the project compared to the `upstream` repository.

#### Build Preferences
While working with the project, it's possible to set various environmental variables to configure it to your own preferences:

- `GMC_DEFAULT_LANG` - is a 2-character language identifier (it must be present in the `mkdocs.yml` file), it sets the default language of the site
- `GMC_ONLY_DEFAULT_LANG` - `True` or `False` value, activates the site build to be only in the default language
- `GMC_ENABLE_ON_PUBLISH` - `True` or `False` value, activates all of the final build procedures, like adding of the last modified date, minifying of the resources etc. 

Environmental variables can be set temporarily for the currently open Terminal window:

```bash title="Linux"
export GMC_DEFAULT_LANG=en export GMC_ONLY_DEFAULT_LANG=True; mkdocs serve
```

```powershell title="Windows Powershell"
$env:GMC_DEFAULT_LANG="en"
$env:GMC_ONLY_DEFAULT_LANG="True"
mkdocs serve
```

```batch title="Windows Command Prompt (cmd)"
set GMC_DEFAULT_LANG=en
set GMC_ONLY_DEFAULT_LANG=True
mkdocs serve
```

### Submit a file
If working with _git_ or Markdown is not viable or possible for you, you can submit files in a [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/create) format on the [GMC Discord server][gmc-discord] and we will format and upload it to the page.

!!! warning "Only New English Content"
    This option is limited to new content in English. We can't deal with translations in this manner. For translations send a [translated `.md` file](#add-translated-pages) via a [feedback](#feedback) channel, if you don't want to work directly with _git_, nor add the file via the GitHub interface.

### Translations
To provide multilingual support, our site uses the [MkDocs i18n](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n/) plugin.

#### Add new language support
To support a new language it needs to be added:

!!! danger "Indentation is important"
    You must preserve the correct amount of indentation, aka spacing between entries.

1. In the `mkdocs.yml` configuration, in this example we're adding the `xx` language:

    ```yaml
    plugins:
      - i18n:
          # ...
          languages:
            en:
              name: en - English
              build: true
            xx:
              name: xx - Language Name
              build: true
    ```

2. In the `overrides/main.html` file to add the announcement text for untranslated content:

    ```html
    {%
        set announcement = {
            "en": "This page has not yet been translated into LANGUAGE, therefore it is displayed in English.",
            "xx": "yyy",
        }
    %}
    {%
        set call_to_action = {
            "en": "Support us and translate!",
            "xx": "yyy",
        }
    %}
    ```
   
3. Visit the [official theme site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-language/).
     Make sure that the theme translation is complete there. If it's not, just follow their contribution guide and come back here, there is no need to wait for the changes in the theme.

#### Add translated pages
Each `.md` file in the `docs` directory can have a translated version.  
To add a translation for a given language create a copy with an added language suffix.  
For example `index.md` will become `index.xx.md` for the `xx` language based on the settings in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

Each untranslated article has the :material-web-plus: button in the upper right corner next to the title. It allows to quickly add the translation via the GitHub interface without the need for local file configuration.
