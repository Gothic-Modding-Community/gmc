# Welcome to Gothic Modding Community page

This GitHub page is designed to contain community maintained set of articles, tutorials and documentation for everything Gothic.

First two Gothic games use engine called ZenGin, developed by Piranha Bytes and Mad Scientists. If you want to know more about the history of the development, there is a heap of information on the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org/).

The content here is not meant to be taken as the holy word of modding. We are just modders sharing our experiences, knowledge and our favorite work flows.

Feel free to open a pull request with your article or propose changes.

You can open a pull request in [this repository](https://github.com/auronen/gmc/)

!!! note
    This is the `dev` branch. We can use this to check stuff before it goes live on the real site. It runs on [gmc.cokoliv.eu](https://gmc.cokoliv.eu)
