To get a new animation into ZenGin (the Gothic engine) is not difficult per se, I would describe it as tedious. Luckily, there are tools to help us to achieve our goal - get a new animation to be used by the engine, and in effect, to be used and seen in the game. To describe the whole process, I constructed this small tutorial, to help other people to get animations working and to spare them many hours of searching the excellent forum posts, that describe parts of the process.

The animations we are concerned with are the skeletal ones. I divide them into few types myself - I hope to have a demonstration on how to make each on of them. Standalone animation - waving, bowing, eating MOBSI animations - bed, alchemy table, anvil Item animations - sweeping the floor with a broomstick, using the horn, playing the lute Mandatory animations - running, walking, sneaking Combined/interpolated animations - picking stuff up, aiming with a bow/crossbow All of these animations are defined in an MDS file about which we will talk about in the next section.","title":"Animation"},{"location":"zengin/anims/#animation","text":"","title":"Animation"},{"location":"zengin/anims/#animations-in-zengin","text":"Animations (apart from maybe advanced programming work using Ikarus or Union) are one of the most advanced modding techniques, since you not only must understand the way they work, but also know how to write the animation script and understand the whole sceme selection system, naming convention and of course know how to animate (that is my biggest problem :D).

Model animation script is a file, that describes what skeleton is to be used, what body meshes work with this set of animations and how the animations should be named, how fast they run, what animation is supposed to run after the current one is finished and much more. These files are located in Gothic\\_work\\DATA\\Anims\\ directory. You will see a lot of long and scary code, but it is actually very simple, lets learn what some of the most important commands mean. Don't forget to use the search If you search this file for t_Yes , you will get an example of the first type of animation - \"standalone\" To play the animation in game you use this console command play ani t_yes . Syntax and keywords \ud800\udf3e Before we get into the keywords, lets get a quick look at the naming convention, to get a basic idea what is going on. The first letter indicates a type of animation (transition - t_ - or state - s_ ). Then depending on the animation type we have: Transition animation t_Run_2_Sneak Transition animation from the run animation to the sneak animation. t_BSANVIL_Stand_2_S0 Transition animation for the blacksmith's anvil from standing to state 0. State animation s_Run State animation for the looping animation. s_BSANVIL_S0 State animation for the blacksmith's anvil and its first state. ani \ud800\udf3e This is the main command you will be using while defining new animations. Example: ani ( \"t_Yes\" 2 \"\" 0.1 0.1 M . \"Hum_Yes_M01.asc\" F 1 44 ) Syntax: ani ( ANI_NAME LAYER NEXT_ANI BLEND_IN BLEND_OUT FLAGS ASC_NAME ANI_DIR START_FRAME END_FRAME ) ani - is a keyword, we are defining new animation Let's describe all the parameters ANI_NAME - animation name, we use it in Daedalus as animation identifier There is a naming convention, that is recommended (and sometimes required) to be used. prefix t_ - transition animations prefix s_ - state animations - they usually run in a loop prefix c_ - animations used for animation combining/interpolation LAYER - layer number for multi-layer animations NEXT_ANI - name of the next animations BLEND_IN - time in seconds describing animation blending at the start If we set it to 0.5, it takes 0.5 seconds for this animation to take full effect. At 0.0 s the previous animation has full effect on the bones of the skeleton, at 0.1 s it is influenced by 20% by this animation and at 0.5s it is completely influenced by this animation and the previous one has no effect. BLEND_OUT - time in seconds describing animation blending at the end FLAGS - flags, that describe animation behavior M - specifies a movement animation, the animation of the model translates into a changed position in the game world R - the same as M but for rotation E - this flag makes this animation run only, if the animation in the same layer are finished, this is used in the movement animations. The animation s_walk (walking loop animation) runs, when the player is walking,when he stops the transition animation to standing state is played t_walk_2_stand . This animation uses the E flag to wait for the walk cycle animation to finish, to smoothly transition into the standing state. F - the engine ignores height coordinate - doesn't keep the model \"glued\" to the ground (falling/flying animation) I - specifies idle animation - breathing, standing with a drawn weapon and moving the weapon... ASC_NAME - name of the source file exported from Blender ANI_DIR - direction of the animation F - forward R - reverse START_FRAME - on what frame from the source file the animation starts END_FRAME - on what frame from the source file the animation ends aniAlias \ud800\udf3e This is probably the second most useful command, it is used to do, what its name suggests it does, and that is creating an alias (similar to hard link for my fellow unix users) for already defined animations. Example: aniAlias ( \"t_Sneak_2_Run\" 1 \"s_Run\" 0.0 0.1 M . \"t_Run_2_Sneak\" R ) Syntax: aniAlias ( ANI_NAME LAYER NEXT_ANI BLEND_IN BLEND_OUT FLAGS ALIAS_NAME ANI_DIR ) ANI_NAME - name of the new animation LAYER - layer the animation is on NEXT_ANI - name of the next animations BLEND_IN - time in seconds describing animation blending at the start BLEND_OUT - time in seconds describing animation blending at the end FLAGS - flags, that describe animation behaviour ALIAS_NAME - name of the animation we want to use as a source for the alias ANI_DIR - direction of the animation If we look for the animation in the example we can see, that there is a related one just one line above ani ( \"t_Run_2_Sneak\" 1 \"s_Sneak\" 0.1 0.0 M . \"Hum_Sneak_M01.asc\" F 0 10 ) aniAlias ( \"t_Sneak_2_Run\" 1 \"s_Run\" 0.0 0.1 M . \"t_Run_2_Sneak\" R ) In this example we are defining t_Sneak_2_Run animation, we specify, that the animation after this one is finished will be s_Run and that it is being made by reversing animation t_Run_2_Sneak by specifying the R flag. aniBlend \ud800\udf3e AniBlend is used to define animations that are a result of blending of two animations. This animation is not animated by hand, but it is dynamically generated by the engine during run-time. Example aniBlend ( \"t_RunR_2_Run\" \"s_Run\" 0.2 0.2 ) Syntax: aniBlend ( ANI_NAME NEXT_ANI BLEND_IN BLEND_OUT ) ANI_NAME - name of the new animation NEXT_ANI - name of the next animations BLEND_IN - time in seconds describing animation blending at the start BLEND_OUT - time in seconds describing animation blending at the end aniSync \ud800\udf3e Not used in the game. aniBatch \ud800\udf3e Not used in the game.","title":"MDS - ModelScript"},{"location":"zengin/anims/MDS/#mds-model-animation-script","text":"Tip The MDS syntax is very simple and the scripts can be edited in any text editor, but it is easier to work in an editor with the proper syntac highlighting.

The animation s_walk (walking loop animation) runs, when the player is walking,when he stops the transition animation to standing state is played t_walk_2_stand . This animation uses the E flag to wait for the walk cycle animation to finish, to smoothly transition into the standing state. F - the engine ignores height coordinate - doesn't keep the model \"glued\" to the ground (falling/flying animation) I - specifies idle animation - breathing, standing with a drawn weapon and moving the weapon...

Standalone animation \ud800\udf3e Let's start with the easiest animation, lets make a very simple gesturing animation. Info Some of the videos that I write about in the text below are in this play-list . First we have to have the animation source files ready, I usually decompile them using Gothic Sourcer . In GothicSourcer you choose Tools > Decompiler models > Dynamic (MDS or MSB) and choose an MDS file of your choice - Humans.mds in our case and then click the decompile button. Animating \ud800\udf3e Open Blender, File > Import > Kerrax ASCII model (.asc) , navigate to the folder with your decompiled animation files and select HUM_BODY_NAKED0.ASC , this file contains the skeleton and skin model for human NPCs.

And there lies our answer: Model ( \"HuS\" ) { meshAndTree ( \"Hum_Body_Naked0.ASC\" DONT_USE_MESH ) A windows pops up, you can read some interesting information about the model you are about to import, what we are interested in is, that Completely replace current scene is ticked, we want to use Armature modifier , and we also want to Try to connect bones and Use sample meshes from folder . You should provide a path to a directory with the sample meshes - these are meshes for items, that usually go into slot bones.

Click import and wait for the magic to happen. This video shows a freshly imported model with all default meshes. Note Now if we wanted to play (or edit) existing animation, we can now load it on top of this. Just do as before File > Import > Kerrax ASCII model (.asc) and select different animation file (or armour file) for example Hum_SmokeHerb_Layer_M01.asc for an animation file. Gothic characters are modular, you can change their heads on the fly (during gameplay even, as seen in this amazing video of my dear friend and colleague Fawkes - Head changing ), let's add a head, so we can see how the whole body will behave while we are animating. File > Import > Kerrax ASCII model (.asc) and navigate to your head model (for this, you will have to decompile it, like we did with the body itself). I will import HUM_HEAD_PONY.ASC . Please make sure to select the target bone for importing Bip01 Head , this will attach the head to the proper bone, just like the engine does it. Now we have everything ready to start animating.

Since we want our animation to end exactly, as it started - wither because we want the hero to continue his standing animation, or we want to make a looping animation we somehow have to copy the pose. I use the DopeSheet screen, to delete all keyframes and then copy the keyframe set from keyframe number 0 and then drag it somewhere to the end of the timeline.

An object that is derived from the zCObject class may overload the Archive and Unarchive virtual methods. Within these methods, the class may then call on an interface provided by the zCArchiver class, which allows it to directly read from/write to a stream using several modes. Primarily these are ASCII and BinSafe, however, there are more options, as is explained below. Archive format \ud800\udf3e In order to better understand how this process works, it is best to look at an example of a .ZEN file containing an instance of an oCWorld object. Header \ud800\udf3e When you open up a ZenGin archive, you will see the following at the start of the file: ZenGin Archive ver 1 zCArchiverGeneric ASCII saveGame 0 date 7.1.2001 23:9:19 user roeske END objects 2594 END Let's look at each of these properties and what they mean: ZenGin Archive This simply specifies that the following data is a zCArchiver archive. ver 1 Version specification. Can be either 0 or 1 . Both Gothic 1 and 2 are already at version 1, although version 0 archives can also be occasionally found. zCArchiverGeneric Specifies which derived zCArchiver class should be used to read this archive. Accepted values are zCArchiverGeneric for ASCII and Binary archives, and zCArchiverBinSafe for BinSafe archives. More info below. This property may not be present in older archives. ASCII This is the most important part of the header, which specifies in which format the data is stored. There are 4 different modes: ASCII - The simplest mode, which stores data in human-readable ASCII notation (not unlike JSON for example). This is usually used when saving data during development and/or testing, while the final version of said data will most likely be stored as BIN_SAFE. ASCII_PROPS - Same as ASCII except with more additional data that the developer can specify for visual clarity. In practice, it isn't used anywhere and mostly serves only to prettify debug info (try typing ZWORLD VOBPROPS in the console and look in zSpy ;) ). BINARY - Binary representation of the class instance, which mostly copies the data 1:1 into/from the stream. In practice, this format is only used to store savefiles (.SAV). BIN_SAFE - BinSafe, short for Binary Safe, is an extended version of Binary which stores type information along with the data itself. This is meant to make error checking for invalid data easier. There are other changes which are explained below. Most, if not all world files (.ZEN) are stored in this format. saveGame 0 Specifies if this archive is a savefile. This property may not be present in older archives. date 7.1.2001 23:9:19 The date at which this archive was created. user roeske The user which created the archive. This property may not be present in older archives. END Tells the parses that this is the end of the header. In version 0 archives, we may additionally find a property called csum which stores the checksum of the whole archive. However, this property is unused and equals 00000000 by default. In order to correctly read the archive's header across varying engine versions, one should not count on the properties always being in the same order or even being there at all. If the archive utilizes zCArchiverGeneric then this header will also be followed by a short section specifying the number of object instances in this archive. This value will be used to initialize the objectList, which is an array of pointers where the addresses of loaded objects will be stored for later referencing. In older versions, this property would be directly part of the main header. objects 2594 END If the archive is created using zCArchiverBinSafe , then this data will be stored in the following binary structure: struct BinSafeArchiveHeader { uint32_t version ; // Always equals 2 uint32_t objectCount ; // Serves the same function as \"objects n\" uint32_t chunkPos ; // Offset to chunk hash table }; Contents \ud800\udf3e Looking further into the archive, we see what appears to be a nested structure. [% oCWorld:zCWorld 64513 0] [VobTree % 0 0] childs0=int:1 [% zCVobLevelCompo:zCVob 12289 1] pack=int:0 presetName=string: bbox3DWS=rawFloat:-71919.9609 -13091.8232 -59900 108999.992 20014.0352 67399.9922 trafoOSToWSRot=raw:0000803f0000000000000000000000000000803f0000000000000000000000000000803f trafoOSToWSPos=vec3:0 0 0 vobName=string:LEVEL-VOB visual=string:SURFACE.3DS showVisual=bool:0 visualCamAlign=enum:0 cdStatic=bool:1 cdDyn=bool:0 staticVob=bool:0 dynShadow=enum:0 [visual zCMesh 0 2] [] [ai % 0 0] [] [] ... Within ZenGin archives, we primarily differentiate between chunks and properties: Chunks \ud800\udf3e A chunk is a structure that groups properties together. Most of the time, a chunk represents a class instance, however, this is not always true, as classes may arbitrarily create chunks as is needed. For example, the sample above contains a chunk called VobTree , which does not represent a class instance, but only serves to make the reading of the archive easier. While in ASCII mode, the start of a chunk is represented using square brackets. [% oCWorld:zCWorld 64513 0] Inside the start of each chunk, there are 4 pieces of data separated by spaces, which are: Object name - The name of the chunk to use while reading. If the chunk has no name, then it will be simply equal to % . Class name - The name of the class which this chunk represents. Class names are stored with their full inheritance hierarchy (e.g. oCMobLadder:oCMobInter:oCMOB:zCVob ). In case the chunk is not an object, but an arbitrary chunk, then this field will be equal to % ( % can also mean that this chunk is a nullptr). In some cases you may encounter the symbol \u00a7 instead. This means that the object already exists and that the parser should look for it in the objectList using the object index. Using this mechanism, a single instance can be referenced multiple times without worrying about duplicity. Class version - Used to ensure that the data being read is compatible with the current game/engine version, so that there are no mismatches in the data pattern. This value is different for every class and varies between game versions. Object index - An index into the objectList under which this object will be stored. If the class name is equal to \u00a7 , then this value will be used to retrieve an existing instance from the objectList. If this is a Binary archive, the same data will be stored in the following binary structure: struct BinaryObjectHeader { uint32_t objectSize ; // Size of the whole object in bytes uint16_t classVersion ; uint32_t objectIndex ; char objectName []; // Null-terminated string char className []; // Null-terminated string }; Oddly enough, if the archive is BinSafe, then the data will be encoded the same way as in ASCII mode, except that it will be stored as a type-checked property. struct BinSafeObjectHeader { uint32_t type ; // 0x1 = TYPE_STRING uint16_t length ; // Length of the text char text []; // [% oCWorld:zCWorld 64513 0] }; In ASCII mode [] represents the end of the current chunk. Properties \ud800\udf3e Inside the chunks, we find properties, which are key-value pairs that classes use to store the actual data. Each property stores its name, type and value. In ASCII mode the format for this is name=type:value . For example: visual=string:SURFACE.3DS By default, zCArchiver allows to store properties of the following types: Int - A regular 32-bit integer. In ASCII mode, int gets stored as name=int:1 , while in Binary mode, it's just the raw value stored as 4 bytes. Byte - A 8-bit integer. ASCII mode doesn't differentiate between Int and Byte, so this will be stored as name=int:1 regardless. Binary mode stores only the single byte. Word - A 16-bit integer. ASCII mode doesn't differentiate between Int and Word, so this will be stored as name=int:1 regardless. Binary mode stores only the 2 bytes. Float - A standard IEEE 754 32-bit floating point number. In ASCII mode the format is name=float:1.0 , while in Binary mode the float gets stored raw as 4 bytes. Bool - Stores a single-byte boolean value. In ASCII mode its name=bool:1 and in Binary mode it's a single byte. String - An ASCII encoded string. While in ASCII mode, strings are stored as name=string:value . In Binary mode, strings are NULL terminated. Vec3 - A three component vector, mainly used to store positional data. The ASCII mode format is name=vec3:1.0 1.0 1.0 . In Binary mode the three components of the vector are stored in series, which equals to a total size of 12 bytes. Color - A 32-bit color value stored as BGRA. In ASCII mode the color is stored as name=color:255 255 255 255 while in Binary mode it's just 4 raw bytes. Raw - Raw binary data. In order to maintain readability, in ASCII mode this gets stored as a hex encoded string such as name=raw:63D15B07 . In Binary mode, only the data itself is stored, without any other info. Be aware that due to this you must know the size of the data beforehand. RawFloat - An array of floats, mainly used to store bounding boxes. In ASCII mode, the floats are stored as name=rawFloat:1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 . In Binary mode the floats are stored in series as raw bytes. Same as with Raw , you must know the size of the array beforehand. Enum - An enum value. In ASCII mode, it gets stored as name=enum:1 . In Binary mode, it behaves the same as Int . As you might have noticed, binary mode doesn't perform any kind of checks on if it's reading the right property or even data of the correct type. This is why BinSafe mode exists, as it stores the property type in along with the data itself. enum TYPE { TYPE_STRING = 0x1 , TYPE_INTEGER = 0x2 , TYPE_FLOAT = 0x3 , TYPE_BYTE = 0x4 , TYPE_WORD = 0x5 , TYPE_BOOL = 0x6 , TYPE_VEC3 = 0x7 , TYPE_COLOR = 0x8 , TYPE_RAW = 0x9 , TYPE_RAWFLOAT = 0x10 , TYPE_ENUM = 0x11 TYPE_HASH = 0x12 , }; struct BinSafeProperty { TYPE type ; union { struct { uint16_t stringLength ; char stringValue []; } uint32_t integerOrHashOrEnumValue ; float floatValue ; uint8_t byteOrBoolValue ; zVEC3 vec3Value ; zCOLOR colorValue ; struct { uint16_t rawLength ; char rawValue []; } struct { uint16_t rawFloatLength ; float rawFloatValue []; } }; }; Looking at the enumeration of types, you might notice that BinSafe mode has an additional property type called Hash. BinSafe archives include a hash table which is stored in the following manner: struct BinSafeHashTable { uint32_t chunkCount ; for ( chunkCount ) { uint16_t stringLength ; uint16_t linearValue ; uint32_t hashValue ; char text [ stringLength ]; } }; Instead of storing the raw value, properties may save a hash instead, which is then used to look up the corresponding value from the hash table. Implementation \ud800\udf3e As mentioned in the opening paragraph, classes may use the described functionality by overloading the Archive and Unarchive virtual methods, which pass an instance of zCArchiver by reference. When the class instance is then serialized and/or parsed, these methods are called and perform the desired serialization/parsing work. Within these routines, the class uses methods provided by the zCArchiver instance. These methods return/accept a value of a specific type (e.g. ReadInt/WriteInt), while they do the actual reading/writing work behind the scenes based on the current mode (ASCII/Binary/BinSafe). The programmer writing the class then does not care whether the final archive will be saved as ASCII, Binary or BinSafe, as they only use the zCArchiver Read* and Write* methods. A practical example \ud800\udf3e Let's propose that we have a class which is declared like so: class zCMyClass : public zCObject { public : zCMyClass () {} virtual ~ zCMyClass () {} virtual void Archive ( zCArchiver & ); virtual void Unarchive ( zCArchiver & ); int myInt ; zCMyClass * myObject ; zCMyClass * secondPointerToMyObject ; }; The hypothetical class then implements these virtual functions: void zCMyClass::Archive ( zCArchiver & archiver ) { archiver . WriteInt ( \"myInt\" , myInt ); archiver . WriteObject ( \"myObject\" , myObject ); archiver . WriteChunkStart ( \"myChunk\" , 0 ); archiver . WriteObject ( \"secondPointerToMyObject\" , secondPointerToMyObject ); archiver . WriteChunkEnd (); } void zCMyClass::Unarchive ( zCArchiver & archiver ) { archiver . ReadInt ( \"myInt\" , myInt ); myObject = dynamic_cast < zCMyClass *> ( archiver . ReadObject ( \"myObject\" )); archiver . ReadChunkStart ( \"myChunk\" ); secondPointerToMyObject = dynamic_cast < zCMyClass *> ( archiver . ReadObject ( \"secondPointerToMyObject\" )); archiver . ReadChunkEnd (); } We then initialize the class in the following way: zCMyClass object ; object . myInt = 12121212 ; object . myObject = new zCMyClass (); object . myObject -> myInt = 34343434 ; object . secondPointerToMyObject = object . myObject ; If we now serialized, or to use the engine's term \"archived\", this instance into an ASCII archive, the result would look like this: ZenGin Archive ver 1 zCArchiverGeneric ASCII saveGame 0 date 3.7.2022 0:0:0 user GMC END objects 2 END [% zCMyClass 0 0] myInt=int:12121212 [myObject zCMyClass 0 1] myInt=int:34343434 [myObject % 0 0] [] [myChunk % 0 0] [secondPointerToMyObject % 0 0] [] [] [] [myChunk % 0 0] [secondPointerToMyObject \u00a7 0 1] [] [] [] Notice how secondPointerToMyObject doesn't have any contents. The character \u00a7 tells the parser that this object already exists in the objectList, and that instead of creating a new instance, it should return an existing instance which is stored under index 1 in the objectList. This allows an instance to be referenced from multiple places, without the need to worry about duplicity. If we used Binary or BinSafe mode, we would see a big blob of binary data instead. This would of course store the exact same data, although in a slightly less human-readable format. Final thoughts \ud800\udf3e I hope this helps you better understand the inner workings of ZenGin.

An object that is derived from the zCObject class may overload the Archive and Unarchive virtual methods. Within these methods, the class may then call on an interface provided by the zCArchiver class, which allows it to directly read from/write to a stream using several modes. Primarily these are ASCII and BinSafe, however, there are more options, as is explained below.","title":"Object persistence"},{"location":"zengin/general_info/ObjectPersistence/#archive-format","text":"In order to better understand how this process works, it is best to look at an example of a .ZEN file containing an instance of an oCWorld object.","title":"Archive format"},{"location":"zengin/general_info/ObjectPersistence/#header","text":"When you open up a ZenGin archive, you will see the following at the start of the file: ZenGin Archive ver 1 zCArchiverGeneric ASCII saveGame 0 date 7.1.2001 23:9:19 user roeske END objects 2594 END Let's look at each of these properties and what they mean: ZenGin Archive This simply specifies that the following data is a zCArchiver archive. ver 1 Version specification. Can be either 0 or 1 . Both Gothic 1 and 2 are already at version 1, although version 0 archives can also be occasionally found. zCArchiverGeneric Specifies which derived zCArchiver class should be used to read this archive. Accepted values are zCArchiverGeneric for ASCII and Binary archives, and zCArchiverBinSafe for BinSafe archives. More info below. This property may not be present in older archives. ASCII This is the most important part of the header, which specifies in which format the data is stored. There are 4 different modes: ASCII - The simplest mode, which stores data in human-readable ASCII notation (not unlike JSON for example). This is usually used when saving data during development and/or testing, while the final version of said data will most likely be stored as BIN_SAFE. ASCII_PROPS - Same as ASCII except with more additional data that the developer can specify for visual clarity. In practice, it isn't used anywhere and mostly serves only to prettify debug info (try typing ZWORLD VOBPROPS in the console and look in zSpy ;) ). BINARY - Binary representation of the class instance, which mostly copies the data 1:1 into/from the stream. In practice, this format is only used to store savefiles (.SAV). BIN_SAFE - BinSafe, short for Binary Safe, is an extended version of Binary which stores type information along with the data itself. This is meant to make error checking for invalid data easier. There are other changes which are explained below. Most, if not all world files (.ZEN) are stored in this format. saveGame 0 Specifies if this archive is a savefile. This property may not be present in older archives. date 7.1.2001 23:9:19 The date at which this archive was created. user roeske The user which created the archive. This property may not be present in older archives. END Tells the parses that this is the end of the header. In version 0 archives, we may additionally find a property called csum which stores the checksum of the whole archive. However, this property is unused and equals 00000000 by default. In order to correctly read the archive's header across varying engine versions, one should not count on the properties always being in the same order or even being there at all. If the archive utilizes zCArchiverGeneric then this header will also be followed by a short section specifying the number of object instances in this archive. This value will be used to initialize the objectList, which is an array of pointers where the addresses of loaded objects will be stored for later referencing. In older versions, this property would be directly part of the main header. objects 2594 END If the archive is created using zCArchiverBinSafe , then this data will be stored in the following binary structure: struct BinSafeArchiveHeader { uint32_t version ; // Always equals 2 uint32_t objectCount ; // Serves the same function as \"objects n\" uint32_t chunkPos ; // Offset to chunk hash table };","title":"Header"},{"location":"zengin/general_info/ObjectPersistence/#contents","text":"Looking further into the archive, we see what appears to be a nested structure.

Most of the time, a chunk represents a class instance, however, this is not always true, as classes may arbitrarily create chunks as is needed. For example, the sample above contains a chunk called VobTree , which does not represent a class instance, but only serves to make the reading of the archive easier. While in ASCII mode, the start of a chunk is represented using square brackets. [% oCWorld:zCWorld 64513 0] Inside the start of each chunk, there are 4 pieces of data separated by spaces, which are: Object name - The name of the chunk to use while reading. If the chunk has no name, then it will be simply equal to % . Class name - The name of the class which this chunk represents. Class names are stored with their full inheritance hierarchy (e.g. oCMobLadder:oCMobInter:oCMOB:zCVob ). In case the chunk is not an object, but an arbitrary chunk, then this field will be equal to % ( % can also mean that this chunk is a nullptr). In some cases you may encounter the symbol \u00a7 instead. This means that the object already exists and that the parser should look for it in the objectList using the object index. Using this mechanism, a single instance can be referenced multiple times without worrying about duplicity. Class version - Used to ensure that the data being read is compatible with the current game/engine version, so that there are no mismatches in the data pattern. This value is different for every class and varies between game versions. Object index - An index into the objectList under which this object will be stored. If the class name is equal to \u00a7 , then this value will be used to retrieve an existing instance from the objectList.

These functions are called independently after a specified period of time. These triggers can also store a user information, up to 16 int variables can be stored in each trigger, as well as self , other and victim instances. Class definition \ud800\udf3e To define a trigger, the C_Trigger class is used: /// Union zPraserExtender Trigger class class C_Trigger { var int Delay ; // defines the frequency (in miliseconds) at which the function will be called. var int Enabled ; // determines if the trigger is active.

You can, of course, configure the instance after its creation (for example to fill in the AIVariables with relevant data). The trigger function has the required signature if 'func int f()'. It must return a value indicating the state of the loop - if the function returns LOOP_END the trigger will be stopped and the instance deleted, if LOOP_CONTINUE is returned, the function will be called again after Delay ms have passed. Poison example \ud800\udf3e // Implement a trigger to simulate the effect of poison debuff: // Let's create a trigger on function `c_loop` with a call interval of 1 second. // When the function is called, the instance hero will be placed in self (although it can be any other NPC if desired). // The rest of the instances are left null (not used). var C_Trigger trigger ; trigger = AI_StartTriggerScriptEx ( \"c_loop\" , 1000 , hero , null , null ); trigger .

A trigger is considered local if it has been presented with at least one NPC in self , other or victim (not null ). If you want to create a trigger, but without linking to any NPC, it is recommended to simply pass hero as self to the trigger. Saving \ud800\udf3e The plugin creates a new save archive to save the information of the triggers, that does not conflict with any of the built-in save files.
